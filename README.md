## Motivation
My journey into learning design patterns began when I encountered frequent mentions of design pattern names during work-related communications and in library documentation. 
Due to my limited knowledge of design patterns, I found it challenging to understand and communicate effectively, leading to higher comprehension costs. 
To address this issue, I decided to embark on a systematic study of design patterns, aiming to enhance my communication efficiency and understanding speed.

By learning design patterns through this repository and the book "Java言語で学ぶデザインパターン入門 第3版", 
I hope to gain a solid foundation in these reusable solutions and improve my ability to grasp and discuss software design concepts with colleagues and peers.

## Design Pattern (WIP)
